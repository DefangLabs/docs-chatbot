    "text": ":::info Public Beta of the v1 Defang BYOC AWS Provider is released as of Feb 1 2024. ::: Why should you use Defang with AWS? Defang allows you to easily create and manage full, scalable applications with AWS. Defang aims to make it easier to deploy your services to the cloud. Don't waste your time learning the ins and outs of AWS, deciding which of the 200+ services to use, and then writing the infrastructure code to deploy your services, and making sure they are properly secured. Defang does all of that for you. Getting started with the Defang BYOC AWS Provider is easy. First, make sure you [install the latest version of the Defang CLI](../getting-started#authenticate-with-defang). Then, make sure you have properly [authenticated your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html). The Defang CLI will automatically check for environment variables like `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. If they are set, the CLI will automatically use the Defang BYOC AWS Provider using the appropriate credentials. If you have credentials in the `~/.aws/credentials` file, but nothing configured in environment variables, you can use the `--provider=aws` flag to tell the Defang CLI to use the AWS Provider. :::tip If you have the aws CLI installed, you should be able to successfully run `aws sts get-caller-identity` and see your account ID. ::: :::warning The Defang CLI does not depend on the AWS CLI. It uses the [AWS SDK for Go](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/) to interact with your AWS account. In most cases, if you can run the `aws sts get-caller-identity` from the tip above, you should be good to go. However, due to a difference between the AWS CLI and the AWS SDK for Go, there is at least one case where they behave differently: if you are using `aws sso login` and have clashing profiles in your `.aws/config` and `.aws/credentials` files, the AWS CLI will prioritize SSO profiles and caches over regular profiles, but the AWS SDK for Go will prioritize the credentials file, and it may fail. ::: The Defang BYOC AWS Provider will use the region specified in the `AWS_REGION` environment variable, or a profile in the `~/.aws/config` file exactly as the AWS CLI would. Defang uses resources that are native to the cloud provider you are using. The following describes the current state of Defang's support for AWS, the specific resources that Defang uses, and the roadmap for future support. Defang allows you to configure your services with sensitive config values. Sensitive values are stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, and are encrypted. To deploy your services, the Defang CLI packages your code and uploads it to an S3 bucket in your account. The CLI then deploys an ECS task that uses Pulumi to build your container image and run your service. The provider runs your workloads using ECS using Fargate. It provisions a VPC with public and private subnets, and deploys your services to the private subnets. It then provisions an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and routes traffic to your services. When using [Managed Redis](../concepts/managed-storage.md#managed-redis), the Defang CLI provisions an ElastiCache Redis cluster in your account."

At the end of this section we will also cover use cases that are not supported by Defang. Defang can be used to deploy web services and APIs. You can use any programming language you like, and you can use the built-in AI assistant to help you get started. Defang is a great choice for stateless web services and APIs because it takes care of all the heavy lifting such as configuring [networking](../concepts/networking.mdx), [security](../concepts/security.md), and [observability](../concepts/observability.md), and will give you a nice, [horizontally scalable](https://12factor.net/concurrency) deployment. If you are using [Defang BYOC](../concepts/defang-byoc.md), you can easily connect to databases, storage, and other services that you have running in your cloud account. A mobile app backend is a web service or API that is used by a mobile app. Defang is a great choice for mobile app backends because it helps you deploy horizontally scalable web services and APIs. It's also particularly useful for mobile app developers who aren't familiar with cloud infrastructure: you don't need to be a cloud expert, or even a web expert to use Defang and properly provision all the necessary infrastructure for your app's backend. LLMs (Large Language Models) are a type of AI model that can be used for a wide variety of tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, and more. Defang can be used to host LLMs and provide an API for them. Configuring cloud providers like AWS to easily run containerized workloads that depend on GPUs can be quite challenging, but Defang makes it easy."

    "about": "Anti-patterns, Stateful Services, Data Stores",
    "text": "While Defang is great for a wide variety of use cases, there are some use cases that are not a good fit for Defang. Generally, the use-cases that are Defang anti-patterns are the same as the ones that are [12 Factor](https://12factor.net/) anti-patterns. Here are some examples: Some applications are designed to run in stateful environments. For example, a CMS like WordPress can be coerced to work in a stateless environment, but most of the tooling for it expects to have a long-lived filesystem and a database. Defang is not a good fit for these types of applications, because [containers are ephemeral and can be replaced at any time](https://12factor.net/processes). Defang is not a good fit for data stores like databases, caches, and message queues. These types of services are designed to be long-lived and to store data. Defang is primarily designed for stateless workloads, and it's not a good fit for stateful workloads: if a container is replaced, all the data in it is lost. You could probably coerce a data store to work in a stateless environment with certain replication strategies, but it's not a good fit."

To get started with Pulumi and Defang you will need to install the Defang provider in [your Pulumi project](https://www.pulumi.com/learn/pulumi-fundamentals/create-a-pulumi-project/): <Tabs> <TabItem value=\"npm\" label=\"npm\" default> ```bash npm i @defang-io/pulumi-defang ``` </TabItem> <TabItem value=\"pnpm\" label=\"pnpm\"> ```bash pnpm i @defang-io/pulumi-defang ``` </TabItem> <TabItem value=\"yarn\" label=\"yarn\"> ```bash yarn add @defang-io/pulumi-defang ``` </TabItem> </Tabs> The following is a minimal example of a Pulumi program that defines a Defang service: ```typescript import * as defang from \"@defang-io/pulumi-defang/lib\"; const service = new defang.DefangService(\"my-service\", { image: \"strm/helloworld-http:latest\", ports: [{ target: 80, mode: \"ingress\", protocol: \"http\", }], }); ```"

It's a simple way to define and run multi-container Docker applications. Defang allows you to use `compose.yaml` files to deploy your application to the cloud. You can define your [services](./services.md) using a `compose.yaml` file in the root of your project, or use the [`defang generate` command](../tutorials/generate-new-code-using-ai.mdx) to generate one (along with other resources). This file is used to define your application's services and how they run. You can edit this file to add more services or change the configuration of existing services. When you run `defang up`, Defang will read your `compose.yaml` file and [deploy](./deployments.md) the services named in that file to the cloud. One thing to keep in mind is that, at the time of this writing, Defang identifies services by the [user/account name](./accounts.md) and the service name (as defined in the `compose.yaml` file). This means that if you have multiple Defang projects with the same service name, they will conflict with each other. We plan to provide a more robust system for managing service names and protecting against conflicts in the future.

Mine says \"Reinstall\" because I've already installed it. ![screenshot of the slack admin UI showing the install button](/img/slackbot-sample/install-app.png) 4. **Copy the Bot User OAuth Access Token:** This token will authenticate your Slackbot with the Slack API. ![screenshot of the slack admin UI showing the auth token field](/img/slackbot-sample/token.png) 5. **Invite the Bot to a Channel:** To enable your Slackbot, invite it to the desired channel using the `@<botname>` command. In the screenshot below, my bot's name actually starts with the word invite, but if your bot is called `mycoolbot` you would invite it with `@mycoolbot`. This ensures your Slackbot has the required permissions to interact with the channel. ![screenshot of the slack chat UI showing me inviting my bot](/img/slackbot-sample/invite.png) 6. **Clone the Sample Code:** Clone the Defang repository and navigate to the `samples/golang/slackbot` directory. This directory contains the sample code for the Slackbot. ```bash git clone https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang cd defang/samples/golang/slackbot ```"

Follow these steps to deploy your Slackbot effortlessly: 1.  **Set Up Secrets:** Prioritize security by configuring environment variables as sensitive config. Use the Defang CLI's `defang config set` command to set the `SLACK_TOKEN` and `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` configs. Replace `your_slack_token` and `your_slack_channel_id` with the respective values: ```bash defang config set --name SLACK_TOKEN --value your_slack_token defang config set --name SLACK_CHANNEL_ID --value your_slack_channel_id ``` 2.  **Deploy the Slackbot:**  Use the Defang CLI's `defang compose up` command to deploy."

Simply send a POST request to the `/` endpoint with a JSON body containing the message you want to post to the Slack channel. Popular tools like cURL or Postman can help you send the request: ```bash curl 'https://raphaeltm-bot--8080.prod1.defang.dev/' \\ -H 'content-type: application/json' \\ --data-raw $'{\"message\":\"This is your bot speaking. We\\'ll be landing in 10 minutes. Please fasten your seatbelts.\"}' ```"
