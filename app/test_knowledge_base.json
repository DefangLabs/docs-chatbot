    "text": "Defang can be used for a wide variety of use cases, generally in line with the [12 Factor architecture](https://12factor.net/). In this section we'll document some examples. At the end of this section we will also cover use cases that are not supported by Defang. Defang can be used to deploy web services and APIs. You can use any programming language you like, and you can use the built-in AI agent to help you get started. Defang is a great choice for stateless web services and APIs because it takes care of all the heavy lifting such as configuring [networking](../concepts/networking.mdx), [security](../concepts/security.md), and [observability](../concepts/observability.md), and will give you a nice, [horizontally scalable](https://12factor.net/concurrency) deployment. If you are using [Defang BYOC](../concepts/defang-byoc.md), you can easily connect to databases, storage, and other services that you have running in your cloud account. A mobile app backend is a web service or API that is used by a mobile app. Defang is a great choice for mobile app backends because it helps you deploy horizontally scalable web services and APIs. It's also particularly useful for mobile app developers who aren't familiar with cloud infrastructure: you don't need to be a cloud expert, or even a web expert to use Defang and properly provision all the necessary infrastructure for your app's backend. LLMs (Large Language Models) are a type of AI model that can be used for a wide variety of tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, and more. Defang can be used to host LLMs and provide an API for them. Configuring cloud providers like AWS to easily run containerized workloads that depend on GPUs can be quite challenging, but Defang makes it easy."

    "text": "While Defang is great for a wide variety of use cases, there are some use cases that are not a good fit for Defang. Generally, the use-cases that are Defang anti-patterns are the same as the ones that are [12 Factor](https://12factor.net/) anti-patterns. Some applications are designed to run in stateful environments. For example, a CMS like WordPress can be coerced to work in a stateless environment, but most of the tooling for it expects to have a long-lived filesystem and a database. Defang is not a good fit for these types of applications, because [containers are ephemeral and can be replaced at any time](https://12factor.net/processes). Defang now offers support for stateful workloads through our [managed storage](/docs/concepts/managed-storage) options, including [Postgres](/docs/concepts/managed-storage/managed-postgres) and [Redis](/docs/concepts/managed-storage/managed-redis) for data stores. However, we do not recommend using unsupported data stores with Defang, as this may lead to permanent data loss. :::info To better serve our users, we will be introducing additional managed storage options, such as [Object Storage](/docs/concepts/managed-storage/managed-object-storage), in the near future. ::: Please be aware that if you choose not to use a Defang-supported [managed storage](/docs/concepts/managed-storage) option, there is a risk that any data stored in a container may be lost if the container is replaced."

    "text": "- This happens if different version of the Defang CLI are used with the same AWS account. Each version one will try to update the CD stack to its version, back and forth. Make sure that all users have the same version of the CLI. Check the CLI version using `defang version`. - This message is displayed when `defang compose up` tries to deploy a service with an \"ingress\" port, if the service does not have a `healthcheck` which mentions `localhost`. Defang routes a load balancer to your service's ingress ports, and the loadbalancer needs to be able to check the health of the service. To solve this issue, ask yourself these two questions: 1. Should my service be public? It's common to declare your container's ports using the Compose file \"shorthand\" syntax (`1234:1234`). This syntax can be understood as `[HOST:]CONTAINER`. If your service is not intended to be public, you do not need to declare a HOST port. For example: ```diff services: my-service: image: my-image ports: -       - \"1234:1234\" +       - \"1234\" ``` 2. Does my healthcheck include the string `localhost`? It is very common to define a healthcheck by using `curl` or `wget` to make a request to `localhost`. So common, in fact, that Defang will look for the string `localhost` in your healthcheck definition. For example, this healthcheck is valid: ```yaml healthcheck: test: [\"CMD\", \"curl\", \"-f\", \"http://localhost:1234/health\"] ``` This healthcheck is not valid for `ingress` ports: ```yaml healthcheck: test: [\"CMD\", \"./my-healthcheck\"] ``` The image build might fail if the build process uses too much memory. The first thing to try is to limit the size of your project by excluding unnecessary files: the easiest way is to create a `.dockerignore` file that excludes irrelevatn files. Note that Defang will use a default `.dockerignore` file if you don't have one, but that default might not work for some projects and it's always better to make a `.dockerignore` file specific to your project. If that doesn't work, see our [Resources](/docs/concepts/resources#build-time-resources) documentation for more information on how to configure the memory requirements and disk space requirements for your image builds."

However, due to a difference between the AWS CLI and the AWS SDK for Go, there is at least one case where they behave differently: if you are using `aws sso login` and have clashing profiles in your `.aws/config` and `.aws/credentials` files, the AWS CLI will prioritize SSO profiles and caches over regular profiles, but the AWS SDK for Go will prioritize the credentials file, and it may fail. ::: The Defang BYOC AWS Provider will use the region specified in the `AWS_REGION` environment variable, or a profile in the `~/.aws/config` file exactly as the AWS CLI would. Defang uses resources that are native to the cloud provider you are using. The following describes the current state of Defang's support for AWS, the specific resources that Defang uses, and the roadmap for future support. Defang allows you to configure your services with sensitive config values. Sensitive values are stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, and are encrypted. To deploy your services, the Defang CLI packages your code and uploads it to an S3 bucket in your account. The CLI then deploys an ECS task that uses Pulumi to build your container image and run your service. The provider runs your workloads using ECS using Fargate. It provisions a VPC with public and private subnets, and deploys your services to the private subnets. It then provisions an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and routes traffic to your services. Defang uses a Route53 private hosted zone for service discovery. Each (private) service in the Compose file will get a CNAME or A record which resolves to the service's AWS domain name or IP, respectively. To update the A records for the dynamically assigned IP addresses, Defang will add a [Route53 sidecar](https://github.com/DefangLabs/route53-sidecar) alongside your container. Defang can help you provision [managed storage](/docs/concepts/managed-storage/managed-storage.md) services. The following managed storage services are supported on AWS: When using [Managed Postgres](/docs/concepts/managed-storage/managed-postgres.md), the Defang CLI provisions an RDS Postgres instance in your account. When using [Managed Redis](/docs/concepts/managed-storage/managed-redis.md), the Defang CLI provisions an ElastiCache Redis cluster in your account. Defang will create and manage the following resources in your AWS account from its bootstrap CloudFormation template: | Resource Type | Example Resource Name | |---------------|------------------------| | s3/Bucket | defang-cd-bucket-cbpbzz8hzm7  | | ecs/ClusterCapacityProviderAssociations | defang-cd-Cluster-pqFhjwuklvm | | ecs/Cluster | defang-cd-ClusterpJqFhjwuklvm  | | iam/Role | defang-cd-ExeutionRole-XE7RbQDfeEwx  | | ec2/InternetGateway | igw-05bd7adc92541ec3  | | ec2/VPCGatewayAttachment | IGW|vpc-0cbca64f13435695 | | logs/LogGroup | defang-cd-Logroup-6LSZet3tFnEy  | | ecr/PullThroughCacheRule | defang-cd-ecrpublic | | ec2/Route | rtb-08f3f5afc9e6c8c8|0.0.0.0/0 | | ec2/RouteTable | rtb-08f3f5ffc9e6c8c8 | | ec2/VPCEndpoint | vpce-02175d8d4f47d0c9  | | ec2/SecurityGroup | sg-032b839c63e70e49  | | ec2/Subnet | subnet-086bead399ddc8a0  | | ec2/SubnetRouteTableAssociation | rtbassoc-02e200d45e7227fe | | ecs/TaskDefinition | arn:aws:ecsus-west-2:381492210770:task-definition/defang-cd-TaskDefinition-RXd5tf9TaN38:1 | | iam/Role | defang-cd-askRole-gsEeDPd6sPQY  | | ec2/VPC | vpc-0cbca64f13435695  | Then, for each project you deploy, Defang will create and manage the following resources: | Resource Type | Example Resource Name | |---------------|------------------------| | ecr/Repository | project1/kaniko-build | | ecr/LifecyclePolicy | project1/kaniko-build | | acm/Certificate | *.project1.tenant1.defang.app | | ecr/Repository | project1/kaniko-build/cache | | ecr/LifecyclePolicy | project1/kaniko-build/cache | | iam/InstanceProfile | ecs-agent-profile | | iam/Role | ecs-task-execution-role | | cloudwatch/EventRule | project1-ecs-lifecycle-rule | | cloudwatch/EventTarget | project1-ecs-event-cw-target | | route53/Record | validation-project1.tenant1.defang.app | | acm/CertificateValidation | *.project1.tenant1.defang.appValidation | | ec2/VpcDhcpOptionsAssociation | dhcp-options-association | | cloudwatch/LogGroup | builds | | iam/Role | kaniko-task-role | | ecs/TaskDefinition | kanikoTaskDefArm64 | | ecs/TaskDefinition | kanikoTaskDefAmd64 | | s3/Bucket | defang-build | | s3/BucketPublicAccessBlock | defang-build-block | | ecs/Cluster | cluster | | ecs/ClusterCapacityProviders | cluster-capacity-providers | | ec2/SecurityGroup | project1_app-sg | | ec2/SecurityGroup | bootstrap | | ec2/VpcDhcpOptions | dhcp-options | | cloudwatch/LogGroup | logs |"

    "text": ":::warning Pulumi support is currently only available for Defang Playground. We are working on support for Defang BYOC. ::: [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com) is a modern infrastructure-as-code toolkit that allows developers to use a programming language like Typescript to provision and manage cloud resources. Defang provides a Pulumi [_Provider_](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/concepts/resources/providers/) written in Typescript which can be used to deploy Defang services alongside other Pulumi-managed infrastructure. To get started with Pulumi and Defang you will need to install the Defang provider in [your Pulumi project](https://www.pulumi.com/learn/pulumi-fundamentals/create-a-pulumi-project/): <Tabs> <TabItem value=\"npm\" label=\"npm\" default> ```bash npm i @defang-io/pulumi-defang ``` </TabItem> <TabItem value=\"pnpm\" label=\"pnpm\"> ```bash pnpm i @defang-io/pulumi-defang ``` </TabItem> <TabItem value=\"yarn\" label=\"yarn\"> ```bash yarn add @defang-io/pulumi-defang ``` </TabItem> </Tabs> The Defang Pulumi Provider is a good option for developers with more complex requirements than those supported by a [Compose File](/docs/concepts/compose). One reason to use the Defang Pulumi provider is if you wish to integrate your services with other cloud resources. This is particularly true if you need to configure your services dynamically as other cloud resources are being provisioned. Another reason would be if you want to deploy your services alongside cloud-specific resources, like a DynamoDB table, or an S3 bucket.

This file format may look familiar to you if you've used [Docker](https://docker.com). The [Compose Specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/main/spec.md#compose-file) lets you define a platform-agnostic application designed as a set of containers which are configured to run together with shared resources. These applications may be destined for any [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) Container Runtime. Defang does the heavy lifting to deploy to your favourite cloud platform using this file. You can create a `compose.yaml` file in the root of your project, or use the [`defang generate`](../tutorials/generate-new-code-using-ai.mdx) command to create one for you (along with other resources). This file is used to define your application's [services](./services.md) and how they run. You can edit this file to add more services or change the configuration of services. When you run `defang compose up`, Defang will read your `compose.yaml` file and [deploy](./deployments.md) the services named in that file to the cloud.

[Learn how to manage config values with the Defang Github Action](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang-github-action?tab=readme-ov-file#managing-config-values). ::: Environment variables are set within the `environment` section of a service in a `compose.yaml` file. Any variables declared here will become available within the service container. Variables can be set by assigning a literal value, a reference to a configuration value, or a mix of literal and variable references. Variable references are declared using either **\\$\\{variable_name\\}** or **$variable_name** forms. It is recommended to use the bracketed form. By interpolating over variable references within a string we can construct complex strings. Interpolation may be particularly useful when constructing connection strings to other services. ``` service: environment: - USER_PASSWORD // configuration variable - USER_NAME     // configuration variable - CONNECT=dbservice:${USER_NAME}:${USER_PASSWORD}@example.com:9876 ``` In the example above, if we assume the value of the configuration variable ***USER_PASSWORD*** is *password* then the value assigned to ***CONNECT*** will resolve to *dbservice:alice:password@example.com:9876* During `defang compose up` all variable references will be replaced with the actual value and made available in the container. If any referenced variable is not found the `defang compose up` command will be canceled. In Defang, using config with [Pulumi](./pulumi.md) gives you the advantage of being able to manage your environment variables across different environments using Pulumi stacks. :::tip You can find a sample of how to set environment variables with Pulumi [here](https://github.com/DefangLabs/samples/tree/main/samples/pulumi-remix-postgres). ::: If you have created a service before a secret you can connect it by running the `defang compose start` command if using the [`defang compose` workflow](./compose.md).

Clicking this link will prompt the user to create a new GitHub repo with a clone of your project. This new repo will contain a GitHub Actions workflow which will automatically deploy the project to Defang. \n\n## Pre-requisites\n\n- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository for your project\n\n## Step 1 - Prepare Your App\n\nYou will need a `compose.yaml` file in the root folder of your project repository to describe the services which will be deployed. Learn more about writing [Compose files](/docs/concepts/compose#example-of-a-compose-file).\n\n## Step 2 - Copy the GitHub Workflow\n \nIn your project, add a new folder named `.github`, then add a folder named `workflows` inside it, and copy the entire GitHub Workflow `deploy.yaml` file from [here](https://github.com/DefangLabs/samples/blob/main/starter-sample/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml) into the `workflows` folder. \n \nIf your app requires [configuration](/docs/concepts/configuration) (e.g. API keys, passwords, etc.), learn more about [managing config variables with the Defang GitHub Action](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang-github-action?tab=readme-ov-file#managing-config-values). \n\nYou should have a `.yaml` file similar to the one below:\n```yaml\nname: Deploy\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    environment: playground\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: read\n      id-token: write\n\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout Repo\n      uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n    - name: Deploy\n      uses: DefangLabs/defang-github-action@v1.1.3\n```\n\n## Step 3 - Prepare Your Repository\n\nTo support 1-Click Deploy, your repository must be a [Template Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). In order to make your repository into a Template Repository, complete the following steps:\n1. Go to the repository's \"Settings\" near the right on the top bar. \n2. Select the \"Template repository\" box to turn your repo into a template repo, as seen below:\n\n![select-template-repo-box](/img/custom-one-click-tutorial/select-template-repo-box.png)\n\n3. Go back to your repository's homepage.\n4. Click the dropdown menu next to the green \"Use this template\" button near the top right corner, then click \"Create a new repository\":\n\n![use-this-template](/img/custom-one-click-tutorial/use-this-template.png)\n\n5. You will be taken to a page similar to the one shown below.\n\n![create-repo](/img/custom-one-click-tutorial/create-repo.png)\n\nNow stay on this page and continue to the next step.\n\n## Step 4 - Get the Encoded URL\n\nYou will need the encoded version of the URL of the page from the previous step. This will be used as a redirect for the 1-Click Deploy link. \n\n1. Copy the URL of the page you are on ( \"Create a new repository\" page sourced from your template repository). It should look something like the following:\n```\nhttps://github.com/new?template_name=<your-repo-name>&template_owner=<your-github-username>\n```\n2. You need to URL encode your url for the next step. For example, the url above would be encoded as:\n\n```\nhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnew%3Ftemplate_name%3D<your-repo-name>%26template_owner%3D<your-github-username>\n```\n\nYou can just paste your url in here to get the encoded version:\n\n<URLEncode />\n\n## Step 5 - Create the 1-Click Deploy Link\n\nYou will need to create a 1-Click Deploy link with the following format: `https://portal.defang.dev/redirect?url=` + your encoded URL. This ensures that the user can get [logged in](/docs/concepts/authentication/) to Defang before they get redirected to clone your app for deployment. \n\n:::tip\nOptionally, you can add `&name=<your-suggested-name>` to the end of the link if you'd like to suggest a name for the user to use for their deployment.\n:::\n\nThe finished link should look similar to the one below:\n```\nhttps://portal.defang.dev/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnew%3Ftemplate_name%3D<your-repo-name>%26template_owner%3D<your-github-username>&name=<your-suggested-name>\n```\n\nNow you have a link for anyone to deploy your app to Defang, with just 1 click. \n\n## Step 6 - Use the Link\nFor example, you can add it as a link in a Markdown file:\n```\n[1-Click Deploy Link](https://portal.defang.dev/redirect?url=<your-encoded-url>&name=<your-project-here>)\n```\nOr perhaps you can add it to a button with your own styling:\n```\n[![1-click-deploy-button](https://defang.io/deploy-with-defang.png)](https://portal.defang.dev/redirect?url=<your-encoded-url>&name=<your-project-here>)\n```\n\n</URLProvider>"

    "text": "Using [Docker’s `mcp/time` image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mcp/time) and Anthropic Claude, we made a [chatbot application](https://github.com/DefangLabs/samples/tree/main/samples/mcp) that can access time-based resources directly on the user’s local machine and answer time-based questions. The application is containerized using Docker, enabling a convenient and easy way to get it running locally. We will later demonstrate how we deployed it to the cloud using Defang. Let’s go over the structure of the application in a local environment. ![mcp_before](/img/mcp/mcp_before.png) 1. There are two containerized services, Service 1 and Service 2, that sit on the local machine. - Service 1 contains a custom-built web server that interacts with an MCP Client. - Service 2 contains an MCP Server from Docker as a base image for the container, and a custom-built MCP Client we created for interacting with the MCP Server. 2. We have a browser on our local machine, which interacts with the web server in Service 1. 3. The MCP Server in Service 2 is able to access tools from either a cloud or on our local machine. This configuration is included as a part of the Docker MCP image. 4. The MCP Client in Service 2 interacts with the Anthropic API and the web server. **Service 1: Web Server** Service 1 contains a web server and the UI for a chat application (not shown in the diagram), written in Next.js. The chat UI updates based on user-entered queries and chatbot responses. A POST request is sent to Service 1 every time a user enters a query from the browser. In the web server, a Next.js server action function is used to forward the user queries to the endpoint URL of Service 2 to be processed by the MCP Client. **Service 2: MCP Service Configuration** The original Docker `mcp/time` image is not designed with the intent of being deployed to the cloud - it is created for a seamless experience with Claude Desktop. To achieve cloud deployment, an HTTP layer is needed in front of the MCP Server. To address this, we've bundled an MCP Client together with the Server into one container. The MCP Client provides the HTTP interface and communicates with the MCP Server via standard input/output ([stdio](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#standard-input-output-stdio)). **MCP Client** The [MCP Client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client) is written in Python, and runs in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (`/app/.venv/bin`) to accommodate specific package dependencies. The MCP Client is instantiated in a [Quart](https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/index.html) app, where it connects to the MCP Server and handles POST requests from the web server in Service 1. Additionally, the MCP Client connects to the Anthropic API to request LLM responses. **MCP Server and Tools (from the Docker Image)** The [MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/time) enables access to tools from an external source, whether it be from a cloud or from the local machine. This configuration is included as a part of the [Docker MCP image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mcp/time). The tools can be accessed indirectly by the MCP Client through the MCP Server. The Docker image is used as a base image for Service 2, and the MCP Client is built in the same container as the MCP Server. Note that the MCP Server also runs in a virtual environment (`/app/.venv/bin`). **Anthropic API** The MCP Client connects to the [Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started) to request responses from a Claude model. Two requests are sent to Claude for each query. The first request will send the query contents and a list of tools available, and let Claude respond with a selection of the tools needed to craft a response. The MCP Client will then call the tools indirectly through the MCP Server. Once the tool results come back to the Client, a second request is sent to Claude with the query contents and tool results to craft the final response. **Service 1: Web Server - [Dockerfile](https://github.com/DefangLabs/samples/blob/main/samples/mcp/service-1/Dockerfile)** The base image for Service 1 is the `node:bookworm-slim` image. We construct the image by copying the server code and setting an entry point command to start the web server. **Service 2: MCP Service Configuration - [Dockerfile](https://github.com/DefangLabs/samples/blob/main/samples/mcp/service-2/Dockerfile)** The base image for Service 2 is the Docker `mcp/time` image. Since both the MCP Client and Server run in a virtual environment, we activate a `venv` command in the Dockerfile for Service 2 and create a `run.sh` shell script that runs the file containing the MCP Client and Server connection code. We then add the shell script as an entry point command for the container. To define Services 1 and 2 as Docker containers, we’ve written a `compose.yaml` file in the root directory, as shown below. ```yaml services: service-1: # Web Server and UI build: context: ./service-1 dockerfile: Dockerfile ports: - target: 3000 published: 3000 mode: ingress deploy: resources: reservations: memory: 256M environment: - MCP_SERVICE_URL=http://service-2:8000 healthcheck: test: [\"CMD\", \"curl\", \"-f\", \"http://localhost:3000/\"] service-2: # MCP Service (MCP Client and Server) build: context: ./service-2 dockerfile: Dockerfile ports: - target: 8000 published: 8000 mode: host environment: - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY ``` Now that we’ve defined our application in Docker containers using a `compose.yaml` file, we can test and run it on our local machine by running the command: ```bash docker compose up --build ``` Once the application is started up, it can be easily tested in a local environment. However, to make it easily accessible to others online, we should deploy it to the cloud. Fortunately, deploying the application is a straightforward process using Defang, particularly since the application is [Compose-compatible](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/compose). Let’s go over the structure of the application after cloud deployment. ![mcp_after](/img/mcp/mcp_after.png) Here we can see what changes if we deploy to the cloud: 1. Service 1 and Service 2 are now deployed to the cloud, not on the local machine anymore. 2. The only part on the local machine is the browser. Using the same `compose.yaml` file as shown earlier, we can deploy the containers to the cloud with the [Defang CLI](https://docs.defang.io/docs/getting-started). Once we’ve authenticated and logged in, we can [choose a cloud provider (i.e. AWS, GCP, or DigitalOcean)](https://docs.defang.io/docs/tutorials/deploy-to-your-cloud) and use our own cloud account for deployment. Then, we can set a configuration variable for the Anthropic API key: ```bash defang config set ANTHROPIC_API=<your-api-key-value> ``` Then, we can run the command: ```bash defang compose up ``` Now, the [MCP time chatbot application](https://github.com/DefangLabs/samples/tree/main/samples/mcp) will be up and running in the cloud. This means that anyone can access the application online and try it for themselves! For our case, anyone can use the chatbot to ask for the exact time or convert time zones from their machine, regardless of where they are located. ![mcp_time_chatbot](/img/mcp/mcp_time_chatbot.png) Most importantly, this chatbot application can be adapted to use any of the other Docker reference [MCP Server images](https://hub.docker.com/u/mcp), not just the `mcp/time` server. Have fun building and deploying MCP-based containerized applications to the cloud with Defang!"

    "text": "Have you ever looked at a touch screen fridge and wondered how it works? Back in my day (not very long ago), a fridge was just a fridge. No fancy built-in interface, no images displayed, and no wifi. But times have changed, and I’ve learned a lot about embedded systems, thanks to Defang! ![smart_fridge](/img/hardware-story/smart_fridge.png) From my background, I was more into the web development and software side of things. Buffer flushing? Serial monitors? ESP32-S3? These were unheard of. Then one day at Defang, I was suggested to work on a project with a [SenseCAP Indicator](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Sensor/SenseCAP/SenseCAP_Indicator/Get_started_with_SenseCAP_Indicator/), a small programmable touch screen device. Everyone wished me good luck when I started. That’s how I knew it wasn’t going to be an easy ride. But here I am, and I’m glad I did it. What is embedded systems/programming? It’s combining hardware with software to perform a function, such as interacting with the physical world or accessing cloud services. A common starting point for beginners is an Arduino board, which is what the SenseCAP Indicator has for its hardware. My goal was to make a UI display for this device, and then send its input to a computer, and get that data into the cloud. ![hand_typing](/img/hardware-story/hand_typing.png)"

Little did I know that I would encounter this issue many times later, such as when downloading [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/get-started/index.html), a tool for firmware flashing. Figuring out what not to install had become a highly coveted skill. The next part was writing software to display images and text. This was slightly less of a problem thanks to forums of users who had done the exact same thing several years ago. One tool I used was [Squareline Studio](https://squareline.io/), a UX/UI design tool for embedded devices. With a bit of trial and error, I got a simple static program displayed onto the device. Not half bad looking either. Here’s what it looked like: ![ui_static](/img/hardware-story/ui_static.png)"

I used a library called [ArduinoHTTPClient](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoHttpClient). At first, I wanted to ping the server each time a user touched the screen. Then came driver problems, platform incompatibilities, deprecated libraries… … After weeks of limited progress due to resurfacing issues, I decided to adjust my goal to send pings on a schedule of every 5 seconds, rather than relying on user input. I changed the UI to be more colorful, and for good reason. Now, each network ping appears with a message on the screen. Can you look closely to see what it says? ![ui_wifi](/img/hardware-story/ui_wifi.png) This is what the Flask server looked like on my computer as it got pinged: ![local_server](/img/hardware-story/local_server.png) Hooray! Once everything was working, It was time to deploy my Flask code as a cloud service so I could access it from any computer, not just my own. Deployment usually takes several hours due to configuring a ton of cloud provider settings. But I ain’t got time for that. Instead, I used Defang to deploy it within minutes, which took care of all that for me. Saved me a lot of time and tears.

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.defang.io/docs/getting-started#install-the-defang-cli) to get it up and running quickly. 2.  **Slack API Token:** Create a Slack App at https://api.slack.com/apps, granting it the necessary permissions, including the bot `chat:write` scope. ![screenshot of the slack admin UI showing the bot scopes](/img/slackbot-sample/scopes.png) 3. **Install the app in your workspace:** You'll need to install the app in your workspace for it to work. Click the \"Install to Workspace\" button in the Slack admin UI to do this. Mine says \"Reinstall\" because I've already installed it. ![screenshot of the slack admin UI showing the install button](/img/slackbot-sample/install-app.png) 4. **Copy the Bot User OAuth Access Token:** This token will authenticate your Slackbot with the Slack API. ![screenshot of the slack admin UI showing the auth token field](/img/slackbot-sample/token.png) 5. **Invite the Bot to a Channel:** To enable your Slackbot, invite it to the desired channel using the `@<botname>` command. In the screenshot below, my bot's name actually starts with the word invite, but if your bot is called `mycoolbot` you would invite it with `@mycoolbot`. This ensures your Slackbot has the required permissions to interact with the channel. ![screenshot of the slack chat UI showing me inviting my bot](/img/slackbot-sample/invite.png) 6. **Clone the Sample Code:** Clone the Defang repository and navigate to the `samples/golang/slackbot` directory.

    "text": "In October, the Defang team was actively involved in a range of exciting events. We participated in [MLH Cloud Week](https://ghw.mlh.io/events/cloud), [StormHacks](https://stormhacks.com/), and hosted a DevTools Vancouver [meetup](https://lu.ma/devtools2), bringing together local DevTool founders, engineers, and enthusiasts. It was inspiring to see Defang in action, helping these hackers build their amazing projects. ![DevToolsMeetup](/img/october-update/devtools-meetup.jpg) When we shipped our Public Beta earlier in 2024, we had a goal to reach **1000 users** by end of year. **We are pleased to announce that we have already reached this milestone a couple of months in advance!** We are excited to see the momentum behind the product and how our users are using Defang for developing and deploying a variety of different applications. Thank you for your support!"
